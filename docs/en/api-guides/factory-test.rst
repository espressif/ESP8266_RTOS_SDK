Factory Test
************

1. Overview
===========

The document introduces how to develop, compile, download and run the factory test firmware.

The factory test software development kit is also an example of the SDK, and it is located at :example:`examples/system/factory-test`.

2. Development
==============

Users can use ready-to-use applications directly, or can also add custom application code into the factory test software development kit.

More details of adding customer components, please refer to :doc:`Documentation for the GNU Make based build system <build-system>`.   

Users can just develop the factory test application as normal examples of the SDK.

2.1 Application code
--------------------

Just like other applications, the entry function of factory test application is ``app_main``. It should be added into the source code file of users. 
For example, users can add the ``app_main`` into ``main.c`` of the above sample project.

Users can refer to the source code in file :idf_file:`/examples/system/factory-test/main/main.c` to build custom project.


2.2 Linking address
-------------------

The SDK's partition only supports two applications that named as ``ota_0`` and ``ota_1``.

In this case, we link the factory test firmware to the partition of ``ota_1``.
So, please do not flash the factory test firmware into the partition of ``ota_0``.


3. Compile
==========

To make the bootloader run the ``ota_1(factory test firmware)``, 
please enable the ``GPIO triggers boot from test app partition`` and set the ``correct`` GPIO of your development board in menuconfig::

    Bootloader config  --->
        [*] GPIO triggers boot from test app partition
        (12)  Number of the GPIO input to boot TEST partition

Using the partition table file which has two "OTA" definitions partition::

    Partition Table  --->
        Partition Table (Factory app, two OTA definitions)  --->
            (X) Factory app, two OTA definitions

Enable the console which is used for human-computer interaction::

    Component config  --->
        Virtual file system  --->
            [*] Using espressif VFS

Enable pthread for this function::

    Component config  --->
        PThreads  --->
            [*] Enable pthread

Then call command ``make app2`` in the terminal to compile the firmware which is able to run at ``ota_1`` partition.
The ``Make System`` will start compiling bootloader, partition table file, factory test firmware and so on one by one.


3.1 Special Commands
====================

1. ``make app2``: only compile factory test firmware which is able to run at ``ota_1``, ``with`` bootloader, partition table file and so on

2. ``make app2-flash``: flash(download) only the factory test firmware which is able to run at ``ota_1``, ``without`` bootloader, partition table file and so on

3. ``make app2-flash-all``: flash(download) the factory test firmware which is able to run at ``ota_1``, ``with`` bootloader, partition table file and so on


4. Download
===========

Input command ``make app2-flash-all`` in the terminal to download bootloader, partition table file and factory test firmware which is located at ``ota_1`` one by one.

If users only want to download factory test firmware, please use command ``make app2-flash`` instead.


5. Run
======

Please hold the ``correct`` GPIO, which is configured in the menuconfig in Section 3 ``Compile``, to be low level and power on.
Input command ``make monitor`` in the terminal, and then logs will appear like following::
