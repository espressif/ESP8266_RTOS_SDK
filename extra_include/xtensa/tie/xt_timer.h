/*
 * The following prototypes describe intrinsic functions
 * corresponding to TIE instructions.  Some TIE instructions
 * may produce multiple results (designated as "out" operands
 * in the iclass section) or may have operands used as both
 * inputs and outputs (designated as "inout").  However, the C
 * and C++ languages do not provide syntax that can express
 * the in/out/inout constraints of TIE intrinsics.
 * Nevertheless, the compiler understands these constraints
 * and will check that the intrinsic functions are used
 * correctly.  To improve the readability of these prototypes,
 * the "out" and "inout" parameters are marked accordingly
 * with comments.
