This is a simple file for all kinds of stuff related on devlopment for
libcoap. Please append (and remove) any issue you think its worthy.

Classification of issues:
 Critical -> Break the library in some kind or a missing feature, maybe not 
             directly but later
 Serious  -> No regression on the user side, more likly on the libcoap
             development
 Minor    -> Things that are nice to have, but they are not time critical

=================
* CRITICAL ISSUES
=================
-> Remove the #include "coap_config.h" directive from the public header files.
-> Remove #ifdef HAVE_ASSERT_H and so on from the public headers.
-> Use coap.h as the only header to include from the public view.
-> DTLS functionality
 -> Adding DTLS functions based on openssl
  -> Bill Benett has starting some improvements here, please contact him 
     first before starting something
-> Proxy functionality
 -> A coap-server should be able to act as proxy server

================
* SERIOUS ISSUES
================
-> Create some development rules like:
    --> How to submit patches? What about pull requests?
	--> How to implement/change platform related code?
-> Adding some documentation for classical users on how to use the libcoap
-> Clean up the various inclusion for #ifdef __cplusplus #extern "C" {}
-> Adding additional config options (like --with-pdu-size)
-> Split of the platform related code into [foo]_platform.c files
-> In general, improving the online doxygen documentation like creating some 
   additional information for doxygen (startpage, development information, 
   ...)
-> In special, improving ...
