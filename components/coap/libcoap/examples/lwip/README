Example of libcoap running on lwIP
==================================

To run the example, do

    $ make
    $ sudo ./server

(and in a second terminal)

    $ sudo ip a a dev tap0 192.168.0.1/24

and query `coap://192.168.0.2/` with any coap tool.

This will

* download lwip and lwip-contrib from the upstream git sources
* apply a required patch to lwip
* build the server application
* run the server application, creating a virtual network device tap0 (unless
  that exists)
* configure your network interface to make the server accessible.

The server does not create any resources (it exposes an empty
`.well-known/core`), but the work flow for adding more resources does not
differ from regular libcoap usage. If you seem to run out of memory creating
the resources, tweak the number of pre-allocated resources in `lwippools.h`.
