        XTENSA INFORMATION FOR RTOS TICK TIMER AND CLOCK FREQUENCY

This header contains definitions and macros for use primarily by Xtensa
RTOS assembly coded source files. It includes and uses the Xtensa hardware
abstraction layer (HAL) to deal with config specifics. It may also be
included in C source files.

User may edit to modify timer selection and to specify clock frequency and
tick duration to match timer interrupt to the real-time tick duration.

If the RTOS has no timer interrupt, then there is no tick timer and the
clock frequency is irrelevant, so all of these macros are left undefined
and the Xtensa core configuration need not have a timer.

Select timer to use for periodic tick, and determine its interrupt number 
and priority. User may specify a timer by defining XT_TIMER_INDEX with -D,
in which case its validity is checked (it must exist in this core and must 
not be on a high priority interrupt - an error will be reported in invalid).
Otherwise select the first low or medium priority interrupt timer available.

Set processor clock frequency, used to determine clock divisor for timer tick.
User should BE SURE TO ADJUST THIS for the Xtensa platform being used.
If using a supported board via the board-independent API defined in xtbsp.h,
this may be left undefined and frequency and tick divisor will be computed 
and cached during run-time initialization.

NOTE ON SIMULATOR:
Under the Xtensa instruction set simulator, the frequency can only be estimated 
because it depends on the speed of the host and the version of the simulator.
Also because it runs much slower than hardware, it is not possible to achieve
real-time performance for most applications under the simulator. A frequency
too low does not allow enough time between timer interrupts, starving threads.
To obtain a more convenient but non-real-time tick duration on the simulator, 
compile with xt-xcc option "-DXT_SIMULATOR".
Adjust this frequency to taste (it's not real-time anyway!).
