       Enable Espressif SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 & SHA512 for other components to
       save code size for ESP8285(ESP8266 + 1MB flash) users.

       Although this option is disable, bootloader will use it if booloader
       is configured to use SHA256 to check hash.

       Disabling the "assert" function at menuconfig can speed up the calculation.

config ESP_AES
   bool "Enable Espressif AES"
   default y
   help
       Enable Espressif AES ECB, CBC, CFB128, CFB8 & CRT for other components to
       speed up process speed and save code size.

       ESP8285 is like ESP8266 + 1MB flash, but its internal I/O connection from CPU
       core to flash is DIO not QIO, which makes it read flash data slower.
       So the function will speed up ESP8285 obviously.

       The calculation uses "ibus_data" to speed up load data from instruction bus.

       Disabling the "assert" function at menuconfig can speed up the calculation.
