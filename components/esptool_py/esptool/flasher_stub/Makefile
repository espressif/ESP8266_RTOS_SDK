# Makefile to compile the flasher stub program
#
# Note that YOU DO NOT NEED TO COMPILE THIS IN ORDER TO JUST USE
# esptool.py - a precompiled version is embedded in esptool.py,
# so if you don't want to modify the stub code then you are good to go.
#
# See the comments in the top of the Makefile for parameters that
# you probably want to override.
